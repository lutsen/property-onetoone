Lagan One-to-one Property Controller
=====================================

 Controller for the Lagan one-to-one property.  
 Lets the user define a one-to-one relation between two content objects.
 
 The Onetoone property type controller enables a one-to-one relation between 2 Lagan models. The name of the property should be the name of the Lagan model this model can have a one-to-one relation with. Unlike the many-to-many, many-to-one and one-to-many relations, the Lagan model this model can have a one-to-one relation with should NOT have a one-to-one relation with this model as well.

A property type controller can contain a set, read, delete and options method. All methods are optional.

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.net/).
